# Hi!

I'm Vicente Aranda, Full Stack Developer and Life Long Student!

I'm really into what the Web 3.0 can do to our society, so I'm studying about Data Science, Machine Learning and Blockchain in my spare time.

If there is any project you might need a hand, if you want to talk or, well, anything you like, you can find me here!
