# Hi!

I'm Vicente Aranda, Full Stack Developer and Life Long Student!

My main aim is to develop tools and knowledge solve today's more intriguing and complex problems. That's why I'm studying about Data Science and Machine Learning in my spare time.

If there is any project you might need a hand, if you want to talk or, well, anything you like, you can find me here!
